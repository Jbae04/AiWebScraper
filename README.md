# AI Web Scraper with Browser Use + Gemini

This project is a general-purpose autonomous web-scraping agent powered by [browser-use](https://github.com/Browser-Use/browser-use) and Google Cloudâ€™s Gemini 1.5 Pro model. It enables you to define flexible natural language tasks such as:

- Navigating to a website  
- Searching or interacting with page elements  
- Extracting structured data like titles, URLs, descriptions, etc.

This is especially effective for scraping dynamically loaded websites such as YouTube, Reddit, Google Search, and others that rely on JavaScript rendering.

- Embedded browser automation using Playwright via `browser-use`  
- Structured JSON output parsing with Pydantic

- Optional model swapping (e.g., Claude, Ollama, GPT, etc.)
